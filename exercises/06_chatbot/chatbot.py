"""Durable chatbot using Kitaru + PydanticAI.

The chatbot is one agent with a single ``say_and_wait`` tool. The LLM drives
the whole conversation: every time it wants to talk to the user it calls
``say_and_wait(message=...)``, which suspends the run via ``kitaru.wait`` and
returns whatever the user typed back. The agent stops calling the tool when
the conversation is over.

No turn loop, no manual per-turn bookkeeping — the KitaruAgent adapter
wraps model calls in checkpoints for replay. The ``say_and_wait`` tool itself
stays at flow scope because waits must be created outside checkpoints, and a
small explicit checkpoint helper saves the running ``history`` artifact so any
UI can rehydrate a session by loading the latest one.

Recommended workflow:

    # one-time deploy (rerun after editing this file)
    kitaru deploy chatbot.py:chatbot --tag prod --stack <remote-stack> --exclusive

    # invoke from anywhere
    from kitaru.client import KitaruClient
    KitaruClient().deployments.invoke(flow="chatbot", tag="prod")

For quick local interactive terminal testing without deploying,
``python chatbot.py`` runs the flow against the active stack. This direct mode
may block until the conversation finishes. For local non-interactive automation,
use ``drive_local.py`` so one actor runs the flow while another actor answers
pending waits.
